PROS
- Very fast
- Easy to install and use
- Well documented
- In
- Interactive shell
- Sophisticated queries: simple fetch, limit and sliding window retrieve, find by substring or array, aggregation (group, count, min/max, etc), powerful SQL-like server-side language
- Atomic operations: increment/decrement value, push/pop array value
- Indexes fields for fast lookups
- Distributed filesystem with GridFS
- Import/export to JSON and other formats
- Master to many slaves replication
- Replica pairs (they flip between being master and pair)


CONS
- Not meant to be transactional, more like MyISAM autocommit, but has some atomic operations (e.g., increment, pop, plus an eval)
- Relatively new and unproven, although in use on a fair number of sites
- Master-master replication works but is discouraged because there's no way to handle collisions
- Update-in-place, not MVCC, so crashes harder and copes poorly with concurrent updates
